# Solenopsis_invicta_project
This repository is for my GEN 711 final project. In this project I perform transcriptome indexing and read mapping to answer the biological question: Does read length have an effect on gene expression in Solenopsis invicta? and does it differ between virgin and mated S. invicta queens.  


Final images of scatter plots are located in the Solenopsis_invicta_project wiki
